This is a Minecraft Launcher written in Kotlin and Java.
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a Minecraft launcher tailored for Minecraft speedrunning.

## Why did this project start?
The currently popular launchers in MCSR, such as PrismLauncher and MultiMC, include many features that speedrunners don’t need, while it’s often difficult to find the ones that are actually necessary.
\
There was a need to develop only the essential features while providing easy accessibility so users can launch Minecraft for speedrunning more conveniently.
\
Additionally, since mods are constantly updated on platforms like speedrun.com and MCSR Ranked, users need an efficient way to manage their installed mods dynamically.
\
Minimizing the time and effort required for these processes is the ultimate goal of this project.

## Roadmap
The detailed roadmap will be posted on our Discord server.
